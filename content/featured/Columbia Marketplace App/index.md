A fully-functional marketplace iOS app created for the Columbia University community. UI Mockup was first designed in Balsamiq and Figma. Written in Swift assisted by Firebase Products. Multiple stages of refinements were made from user studies and market research. This app allows users to sell, browse, filter, search, favorite, and buy items, as well as message other users.
