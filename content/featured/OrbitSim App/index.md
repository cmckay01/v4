The 3D Solar System simulation, crafted with PyQt5 and Matplotlib, offers a dynamic visualization of planetary orbits, employing Runge-Kutta methods for realistic gravitational simulations. It allows users to customize celestial bodies, control simulations, and view real-time changes. Key features include collision detection, orbit trail toggling, and educational quizzes on celestial mechanics. Utilizing Python's scientific libraries, this tool serves as an educational platform for understanding astrophysical concepts with integrated quizzes and lessons as well. Future expansions are planned for more complex astronomical scenarios such as better collision and black hole rendering.
