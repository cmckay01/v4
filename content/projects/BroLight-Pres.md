Investigated the physical limitations of the ideal filament voltage value range within an experimental apparatus called the BroLight Franck-Hertz Apparatus. Found that the ideal filament voltage range was 1.8-2.8 V. For values less than this range I found that there was not enough current supplied by the apparatus. For values greater than this it was determined that this can damage the apparatusâ€™s internal components which matched expectations but interesting findings were noted in the exponetial increase in current past a certain point due to principles in solid-state physics.
