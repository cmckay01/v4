Developed a custom ray tracing engine in C++ for simulating realistic 3D lighting and reflections. Designed core components (Vector, Ray, Scene, Camera) for scene rendering and perspective control. Implemented Phong shading, optimized for dynamic lighting, rendering speed, and memory efficiency. Generated photorealistic images showcasing complex light interactions, demonstrating engine’s capabilities.
