- NSF REU Internship Program on Nuclear and Particle Physics Research. Partnered with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility on the GlueX experiment. Supported in part by NSF grant PHY-1852006
- Developed and optimized data processing algorithms using C++ and the ROOT software framework, enabling analysis of physics experimental data
- Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team, leveraging version control (Git) to manage codebase changes and ensure consistent data analysis methodologies and utilized a large computing farm at the Jefferson Lab facility to conduct analyses
- Implemented Monte Carlo simulations on novel experimental data to calibrate and evaluate the performance of particle detector called the DIRC, showcasing proficiency in stochastic modeling and computational methods. Ultimately provided support for the data aligning with expected results from the simulations
